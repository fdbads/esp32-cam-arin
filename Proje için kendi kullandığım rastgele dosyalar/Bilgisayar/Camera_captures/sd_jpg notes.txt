19: brightness (br=-2 or -1 is determined)

20: contrast (cnt=0 or 1 is determined)

21: saturation (failed)

22: saturation (sat>=1 increases capture time drastically)(sat=0 is determined)

23: white balance (failed,didnt go from off to on)

24: dont remember

25: white balance (wb=1 is determined)

26: auto white balance gain (one burst failed)

27: auto white balance gain (awbg=1 is determined, but 
    turning it on causes some delay initially)

28: white balance mode (wbm=0 (auto) is determined)

29: exposure_control (ec=1 is determined)

30: aec2(aec2=1 is determined)

31: ae_level ("dont set" is determined)

32: no change after 30->31 (in low light capture fails, possible cause "aec2")

33: exposure_control is disabled

34: low light makes the captures fail, removing parameters until low light is handled

35: same

36: only brightness=0 is left

37: external power supply connected

38: same

39: all previous parameters enabled (crashed and resetted but second run was fine)

40:?

41: single-shot

42: all params deleted

43: wb=1 awbg=1 wbm=0

44: ec=1

45: lens correction = 1 | colorbar = 1 (colorbar is trash, only useful for indicating error)

46: colorbar rem (lens correction does not do anything)

50: long 

51: s->set_agc_gain(s, 30) (started failing capturing)

No save: s->set_agc_gain(s, 0) (fails)

52: set_agc_gain changes over time (near 30, low light fails)

53: set_agc_gain changes over time 0 to 30 (low light still fails)

54: set_agc_gain changes over time 0 to 5 (stick to agc not set)

55: set_agc_gain removed (low light still fails, supply connected,
    brightness is flickering all over the place, may be related to
    the lights being powered by 60Hz mains power)

No save: board died while trying to power externally through Vin, dont do that.

56: new board
